413,"TW: sexual assault  A few years ago I bought an online voucher for a sports massage after injuring myself. I went to the address and a friendly man greeted me and did his best to make me comfortable. I thought it would be a woman...I had never had a massage from a man before before and told myself to stop being silly and that he was was a professional. When I lay on the table he locked the door and assaulted me for just shy of three hours. I screamed, fought, cried but I was trapped. I eventually managed to escape, called the police who sent a male officer to my house to pick up the underwear and clothing I had been wearing when I was attacked. The police arrested him and investigated him-found out he’d done the same to other women both in the UK and abroad. I had to give several recorded interviews. Despite having other women with the same story, DNA evidence from my clothes and hours of my recorded interviews the case has still not been seen due to delays in the system. That man is out there now. Women are not the problem. The system that is meant to punish the men is broken. I have only ever told my mother and a friend this and I’m not sharing it now so you feel sorry for me but rather to raise awareness about how difficult it is to prosecute perpetrators and how women have zero confidence that they’ll be taken seriously.

It was the lowest point of my life. I had lost a career, house, all of my money and almost my mind. With a 5 1/2 week old baby in tow, I had to run for my life.Eventually, I ended up divorced. My ex-husband voluntarily terminated his parental rights to our son as the final blow to me mentally, financially and emotionally. I was in a very low valley for a long time. One day, I surrendered to God and decided to climb out. I’ve lost my grip and fallen back down too many times to count. Still, I keep my eyes toward heaven, a prayer in my heart and determination in my soul. Meanwhile, a now 8 yr old boy, who calls me “Mommy,” continues to provide motivation and purpose.
From hurt to hope. From healed to helping. I no longer live in the past. Instead, I use my experience to give a glimmer of light for others dealing with the darkness of domestic violence.

489,"#metoomovementI believe that there should be a curfew for men and women....
Let me explain before you all dig me out.
All my friends know what I went through and I know my abuser subjected at least 4 other women to the same abuse over the years (with the police knowing and having evidence!)
I had to walk home from work a few times at night after the pub had closed, or I’d walk to the train station about 7pm to get to Kelvedon to see my dear friend Louise. The times I walked the 200m from the pub to my home, my abuser was wanted by police, even though they knew the possible places he’d be they still hadn’t arrested him. I used to borrow a fork from the pub and put it in my coat pocket, just in case... the last time I walked the 200m I am convinced that someone was ‘watching’ I felt uncomfortable, apprehensive, nervous... I’d ring my good friend Esther while walking home or as soon as I’d got in the front door!
I believe that there should be a curfew, for anyone who is a known sex offender, an abuser, someone who has a history of violence whether that’s towards men or women, I believe that these people should not be allowed to walk the streets after dark... As far as I’m concerned they gave that privilege up the moment they raped, beat, humiliated another person!

491,"I had a one-way ticket to a place where all the demons go. Where the wind don't change and nothing in the ground can ever grow. No hope, just lies, and you're taught to cry into your pillow. I have made every single mistake that you could ever possibly make. I took and I took and I took what you gave, but you never noticed that I was in pain. I knew what I wanted, I went out and got it. I did all the things that you said that I wouldn't. I told you that I would never be forgotten and all in spite of you... I survived, I’m still breathing, I’m alive!!! #prettyhurts #metoomovement #SexualAssaultAwarenessMonth #notyourbabe invisaWear Only Human",Positive,NOT,Negative,#prettyhurts #metoomovement #SexualAssaultAwarenessMonth #notyourbabe,
492,"Had a friend who was uncomfortable with asking their child if they had been touched! My response was, “You should be uncomfortable not asking!”Word to the wise: “Ask your children, no matter how good of a relationship you think you have with them or don’t have with them, they may not be forthcoming and just tell you.”",Negative,NOT,Negative,#survivor #askyourchildren #peoplearesick #donttrustanyone #metoomovement,
493,"Yes! Unfortunately this happens all the time. I reported a rape to the Springfield Police and they treated me horribly. He was condescending, rude, and 100% didn't believe a word I said. THIS is why women don't come forward. Between the #timesup and #metoomovement everyone has an opinion on when and how women should speak up.The truth is we do, but people don't care or listen. So it doesn't matter if it's hours or years later, the reception is the same.
And yes, being told to consider what this will do to the other person is truly the most horrible thing you can say.",Positive,OFF,Negative,#timesup and #metoomovement,
494,"Holi is one of the biggest festivals in India and is known to represent the arrival of spring and the triumph of good over evil. While the country is out on the streets, celebrating the festival- women find themselves in uncomfortable situations in their households as well as in public spaces. Under the garb of playing with colours, women continue to face inappropriate behaviour- groping and lewd comments. The whole nonconsensual atmosphere around the festival has not only alienated them from being a part of the festival but has left a lasting emotional impact. According to our online survey, 39% of women in India have been groped on Holi. 45% of women groped on Holi are under the age of 18, and 49% of women have stopped participating in the festival altogether after being harassed.We’ve collaborated with Schbang to start a dialogue about this issue that makes Holi a fearful day for many women as opposed to a fun filled festival.

495,"Sexual harassment in the context of work continues to go unchecked due to the impunity enjoyed by perpetrators and the high tolerance for poor behavior by employers. 8 years into the law in India, we are a long way away from a survivor-centered approach, I argue in this article, published today in the Indian Express.#metoomovement #sexualharassment",Negative,OFF,Neutral,#metoomovement #sexualharassment,
